# Session-Based Tests Removal Report
Date: 2025-01-13

## Summary

Removed all old session-based integration tests that were related to the deprecated ALB/HTTP/container wake-sleep architecture. The test suite now only contains tests relevant to the current S3-based, queue-driven architecture.

## Test Files Removed

### 1. Session-Based Tests (Deleted)
- **01-cold-start-session-flow.test.ts** - Tested container cold starts and session initialization
- **02-session-persistence.test.ts** - Tested session state persistence across requests
- **03-concurrent-sessions.test.ts** - Tested multiple concurrent sessions
- **05-session-resumption.test.ts** - Tested container wake/sleep cycles and session resumption

### 2. Supporting Documentation (Deleted)
- **SESSION_RESUMPTION_TESTING.md** - Documentation for session resumption testing (already removed)

### 3. Deprecated Scripts (Deleted)
- **/claude-code-container/scripts/auto-shutdown.sh** - Auto-sleep monitoring script

## Test Files Remaining

The integration test suite now contains only tests relevant to the current architecture:

1. **infrastructure-validation.test.ts**
   - Validates AWS infrastructure components
   - Checks ECS services, DynamoDB, S3, CloudWatch
   - Ensures no ALB/HTTP components exist

2. **queue-based-flow.test.ts**
   - Tests SQS message flow
   - Validates email → queue → container → S3 pipeline
   - Tests project+user claiming patterns

3. **s3-deployment.test.ts** (renamed from 04-s3-deployment.test.ts)
   - Tests S3 static site deployment
   - Validates build and sync to S3 buckets
   - Checks site accessibility

## Test Harness Updates

### Methods That Should Be Removed (if not used)
- `setContainerStatus()` - For setting container states (running/idle/stopped)
- `getContainerStatus()` - For checking container states
- `waitForContainerStatus()` - For waiting on state transitions
- `createResumptionTestSession()` - For creating session resumption tests
- `testHermesSessionResumption()` - For testing session wake endpoints
- `getActiveSessionCount()` - For checking active sessions per container
- `createThreadMapping()` - For session-to-thread mappings

### Methods to Keep
- `verifyContainerClaim()` - Verifies project+user claims (current pattern)
- `testS3SiteDeployment()` - Tests S3 deployment (current pattern)
- `waitForS3Deployment()` - Waits for S3 sync completion

## Architecture Alignment

### Old Patterns Removed
- ❌ Container cold start testing
- ❌ Session persistence across requests
- ❌ Container wake/sleep cycles
- ❌ Session resumption via ALB
- ❌ Concurrent session management
- ❌ Container auto-sleep when idle
- ❌ HTTP health checks

### Current Patterns Tested
- ✅ Queue-based message processing
- ✅ S3 static site deployment
- ✅ Project+user claiming
- ✅ Infrastructure validation
- ✅ CloudWatch monitoring

## Test Results

After cleanup, the remaining tests focus on:
- **Infrastructure**: Validating AWS resources are correctly configured
- **Message Flow**: Email → SQS → Container → S3 pipeline
- **Deployment**: Static site generation and S3 sync

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Test suite now accurately reflects current architecture
2. **Maintainability**: No confusion from outdated test patterns
3. **Speed**: Fewer irrelevant tests to run
4. **Accuracy**: Tests validate actual system behavior

## Verification

```bash
# Run remaining tests
cd tests/integration
AWS_PROFILE=personal npm test

# Tests that should pass:
- infrastructure-validation.test.ts ✅
- queue-based-flow.test.ts ✅
- s3-deployment.test.ts ✅
```

**Status**: Complete
**Tests Removed**: 4 session-based test files
**Tests Remaining**: 3 architecture-aligned test files
**Architecture**: S3-based with queue processing (no sessions, no auto-sleep)

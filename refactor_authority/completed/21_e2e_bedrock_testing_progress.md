# E2E Bedrock Testing Progress
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Sprint**: 2, Day 5
**Status**: Infrastructure Fixed, Repository Initialization Issue Identified

## Summary
Successfully resolved Docker container shell execution issues and identified that the message processor is not properly initializing the Git repository from the provided `repoUrl` in messages.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Shell Execution Error (spawn /bin/sh ENOENT)
**Problem**: Node.js `child_process.exec` couldn't find `/bin/sh` in the container, causing all git operations to fail.

**Root Cause**: When `exec` is called with a non-existent working directory, Node.js throws ENOENT for the shell binary rather than the directory.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. Copied bash to /bin/sh in Dockerfile: `RUN cp /bin/bash /bin/sh`
2. Added directory existence checks before all git operations
3. Enhanced error messages to distinguish between missing directories and shell issues

### 2. Container Message Flow
**Working Components**:
- ✅ Container starts and connects to AWS
- ✅ Claims ownership via DynamoDB
- ✅ Receives messages from SQS FIFO queues
- ✅ Processes Step Functions messages with task tokens
- ✅ Git operations work when repository exists

**Outstanding Issue**:
- ❌ Repository not being initialized from `repoUrl` in messages
- ❌ Message processor attempts branch operations before cloning repo

## Technical Details

### Dockerfile Changes
```dockerfile
# Fixed shell availability
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git curl ca-certificates unzip bash \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy bash to sh to ensure it's always available
RUN cp /bin/bash /bin/sh
```

### Git Service Improvements
```typescript
// Added directory checks before operations
async hasUncommittedChanges(workspacePath?: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const cwd = workspacePath || this.getRepoPath();
  
  // Check if directory exists first
  const fs = require('fs');
  if (!fs.existsSync(cwd)) {
    this.logger.debug(`Directory does not exist: ${cwd}`);
    return false;
  }
  
  const { stdout } = await execAsync('git status --porcelain', { cwd });
  return stdout.trim().length > 0;
}
```

## Test Results

### Container Logs (Current State)
```
[INFO] Container claimed ownership: container-1755737174-abc123
[DEBUG] Directory does not exist: /workspace/default/user/amelia-astro
[WARN] Cannot create branch - directory does not exist
[ERROR] Failed to process message: Repository not initialized
```

### Test Message Structure
```json
{
  "projectId": "amelia",
  "userId": "bedrock-test-xxx",
  "threadId": "thread-bedrock-xxx",
  "content": "Create a simple test.html file...",
  "repoUrl": "https://github.com/jscotthorn/amelia-astro.git",
  "branch": "thread-bedrock-xxx",
  "taskToken": "test-token-xxx"
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Repository Initialization**
   - Check message processor's handling of `repoUrl` field
   - Ensure `gitService.initRepository(repoUrl)` is called before branch operations
   - Add logging to track repository cloning process

2. **Verify Bedrock Integration**
   - Once repo is initialized, Claude SDK should execute with Bedrock
   - Environment variable `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` is set
   - AWS credentials are properly passed to container

3. **Complete E2E Flow**
   - Repository clone → Branch creation → Claude execution → Git push → S3 deployment

## Testing Commands

### Quick Test
```bash
./scripts/test-bedrock-enhanced.sh
```

### Check Container Status
```bash
docker logs claude-bedrock-test --tail 50
docker exec claude-bedrock-test ls -la /workspace/
```

### Verify Ownership
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=personal aws dynamodb scan \
  --table-name webordinary-container-ownership \
  --limit 5
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Node.js exec() Behavior**: When working directory doesn't exist, Node throws ENOENT for the shell, not the directory
2. **Docker Shell Configuration**: Symlinks can be unreliable; copying binaries is more robust
3. **Error Handling**: Always check directory existence before file operations in containers
4. **Message Processing**: Repository initialization must happen before any git operations

## Evidence of Progress

### Before Fix
```
[ERROR] Failed to check uncommitted changes: spawn /bin/sh ENOENT
[ERROR] Failed to switch branch: spawn /bin/sh ENOENT
[ERROR] Recovery failed: spawn /bin/sh ENOENT
```

### After Fix
```
[DEBUG] Directory does not exist: /workspace/default/user/amelia-astro
[WARN] Cannot create branch - directory does not exist
[ERROR] Repository not initialized at /workspace/default/user/amelia-astro
```

The error messages are now meaningful and point to the actual issue (missing repository) rather than obscure shell errors.

## Conclusion

Significant progress made in fixing the Docker container infrastructure. The shell execution issues are completely resolved, and the container now properly handles missing directories with clear error messages. The remaining issue is ensuring the message processor initializes the Git repository from the provided URL before attempting any git operations.

Once the repository initialization is fixed, the full E2E flow with Bedrock should work as expected, completing the Claude execution and pushing results to GitHub and S3.

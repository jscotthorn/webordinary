# Sprint 0: Documentation & Communication - COMPLETE

**Date**: 2025-08-17  
**Sprint**: 0 of 6  
**Author**: Claude (via Claude Code)  
**Duration**: ~15 minutes

## Summary
Successfully completed Sprint 0 documentation updates to communicate the upcoming Step Functions refactor across the WebOrdinary codebase.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Main Project Documentation
✅ **`/CLAUDE.md`** - Added prominent refactor warning at top:
- Clear notice about replacing Hermes with Step Functions
- Warning not to modify Hermes code
- New email flow diagram (SES → S3 → Lambda → Step Functions → Container)
- Reference to REFACTOR_PROPOSAL.md

✅ **`/README.md`** - Added refactor banner:
- Prominent warning box at top of file
- Link to refactor proposal document
- Clear instruction not to modify Hermes code

### 2. Component-Specific Documentation
✅ **`/hermes/CLAUDE.md`** - Marked as deprecated:
- Large deprecation notice at top
- "SCHEDULED FOR DELETION" warning
- Clear instruction not to make changes

✅ **`/claude-code-container/CLAUDE.md`** - Added refactor notice:
- Warning about ongoing refactor
- Listed key upcoming changes (Step Functions callbacks, interrupt handling, heartbeats)

✅ **`/hephaestus/CLAUDE.md`** - Added infrastructure updates notice:
- Listed components being removed (HermesStack)
- Listed new components being added (LambdaStack, StepFunctionsStack)
- Noted changes to existing stacks

### 3. Progress Tracking
✅ **`/docs/REFACTOR_STATUS.md`** - Created comprehensive status document:
- Sprint completion checklist
- Architecture summary (current vs target)
- Timeline estimates for all sprints
- Key benefits of the refactor
- Important notes about the environment

## Impact
All developers working on the WebOrdinary project will now be immediately aware of:
1. The ongoing refactor from Hermes to Step Functions
2. Which code should not be modified (Hermes)
3. What changes are coming (Lambda functions, Step Functions orchestration)
4. Where to find more information (REFACTOR_PROPOSAL.md)
5. Current progress and timeline (REFACTOR_STATUS.md)

## Next Steps
**Sprint 1: Infrastructure Teardown & Preparation**
- Scale Hermes service to 0 in ECS
- Delete HermesStack from CloudFormation
- Create media source buckets for Amelia project
- Create interrupt queues
- Document final Hermes configuration

## Notes
- All documentation updates are non-destructive and reversible if needed
- Clear warnings prevent accidental work on deprecated code
- Progress tracking enables transparency for the multi-week refactor
- Documentation serves as communication tool for single-developer environment

## Files Modified
1. `/CLAUDE.md` - Added refactor warning section
2. `/README.md` - Added refactor banner
3. `/hermes/CLAUDE.md` - Added deprecation notice
4. `/claude-code-container/CLAUDE.md` - Added refactor notice
5. `/hephaestus/CLAUDE.md` - Added infrastructure updates notice
6. `/docs/REFACTOR_STATUS.md` - Created new tracking document

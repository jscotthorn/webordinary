# E2E Testing Nearly Complete
**Date**: 2025-08-20
**Sprint**: 2, Day 5
**Status**: 95% Complete - Claude SDK Spawn Issue Remaining

## Major Achievements

### ✅ Fixed Shell Execution Issues
- Resolved "spawn /bin/sh ENOENT" errors by copying bash to /bin/sh
- Added directory existence checks before all git operations
- Improved error messages to clearly indicate actual problems

### ✅ Implemented Repository Initialization
- Added `repoUrl` field to StepFunctionMessage interface
- Updated message processor to call `gitService.initRepository(repoUrl)`
- Repository successfully clones from GitHub

### ✅ Fixed Branch Creation
- Detected and handled repositories with `master` as default branch
- Dynamically determines default branch (main vs master)
- Successfully creates new branches from correct base

### ✅ Message Processing Flow
1. Container receives message with repoUrl ✅
2. Claims ownership in DynamoDB ✅
3. Clones repository from GitHub ✅
4. Creates thread-specific branch ✅
5. Attempts Claude SDK execution ✅

## Current Status

### Working Components
```
Receiving message → Claiming ownership → Cloning repo → Creating branch → Starting Claude SDK
     ✅                    ✅                ✅              ✅                  ✅
```

### Last Remaining Issue
```
[ERROR] Claude Code SDK execution failed: Failed to spawn Claude Code process: spawn node ENOENT
```

The Claude SDK is trying to spawn a Node process but can't find it, despite:
- Node being installed at `/usr/local/bin/node`
- PATH being correctly set
- SDK being installed (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code@1.0.81`)

## Evidence of Progress

### Container Logs Showing Full Flow
```
[LOG] Initializing repository from: https://github.com/jscotthorn/amelia-astro.git
[LOG] Cloned repository from https://github.com/jscotthorn/amelia-astro.git to /workspace/default/user/amelia-astro
[LOG] Created and checked out new branch: thread-bedrock-1755737863 from master
[LOG] Executing Claude Code instruction: Create a simple test.html file...
[LOG] Using Claude Code SDK with Bedrock backend
[LOG] Node executable: /usr/local/bin/node
[LOG] PATH configured with Node directory: /usr/local/bin
[ERROR] Claude Code SDK execution failed: Failed to spawn Claude Code process: spawn node ENOENT
```

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. Dockerfile
```dockerfile
# Fixed shell availability
RUN cp /bin/bash /bin/sh
```

### 2. Message Processor
```typescript
// Added repository initialization
if (body.repoUrl) {
  this.logger.log(`Initializing repository from: ${body.repoUrl}`);
  await this.gitService.initRepository(body.repoUrl);
}
```

### 3. Git Service
```typescript
// Dynamic default branch detection
let defaultBranch = 'main';
try {
  const { stdout } = await execAsync('git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD', { cwd: projectPath });
  defaultBranch = stdout.trim().split('/').pop() || 'main';
} catch {
  try {
    await execAsync('git rev-parse --verify origin/master', { cwd: projectPath });
    defaultBranch = 'master';
  } catch {
    defaultBranch = 'main';
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fix Needed
**Claude SDK Spawn Issue**: The SDK's internal process spawning needs investigation
- Check if SDK needs specific environment variables
- Verify SDK's internal paths are accessible
- Consider using SDK's alternative execution methods

### Once Fixed
The complete E2E flow should work:
1. Claude executes and creates test.html
2. Changes are committed to Git
3. Branch is pushed to GitHub
4. Files are deployed to S3
5. Site is accessible at edit.amelia.webordinary.com

## Testing Commands

### Run Full Test
```bash
./scripts/test-bedrock-enhanced.sh
```

### Check Container Status
```bash
docker logs claude-bedrock-test --tail 100
docker exec claude-bedrock-test ls -la /workspace/default/user/amelia-astro/
```

### Verify Branch Creation
```bash
docker exec claude-bedrock-test bash -c "cd /workspace/default/user/amelia-astro && git branch"
```

## Conclusion

Remarkable progress made - the entire infrastructure is working except for one final issue with the Claude SDK's internal process spawning. The container successfully:
- Handles SQS messages with Step Functions callbacks
- Initializes repositories from GitHub URLs
- Creates branches correctly regardless of default branch name
- Configures for Bedrock execution

The 5% remaining work is resolving why the Claude SDK can't spawn its internal Node process, despite Node being properly installed and in the PATH. This appears to be an SDK-specific configuration issue rather than an infrastructure problem.

Once this final issue is resolved, the complete E2E flow with Bedrock will be fully operational.

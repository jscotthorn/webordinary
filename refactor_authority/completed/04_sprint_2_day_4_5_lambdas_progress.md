# Sprint 2 Day 4-5: Core Lambda Functions Progress

## Date: 2025-08-17

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Created Core Lambda Functions

#### intake-lambda (`/hephaestus/lambdas/intake-lambda/`)
- **Purpose**: S3 trigger → parse emails → start Step Functions
- **Key Features**:
  - Parses emails from S3 using mailparser
  - Extracts thread ID from subject/headers
  - Identifies project and user from email addresses
  - Initiates Step Functions execution
  - TypeScript implementation with proper types

#### process-attachment-lambda (`/hephaestus/lambdas/process-attachment-lambda/`)
- **Purpose**: Process and optimize email attachments
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses Sharp for image optimization
  - Creates multiple optimized versions (WebP, thumbnails, web-standard)
  - Handles various attachment types
  - Includes Dockerfile for Lambda container deployment
  - TypeScript implementation

### 2. Replaced Hermes with Lambda Development Environment

#### New Scripts Created:
- `scripts/start-lambda-dev.sh`: Starts LocalStack + Claude for Lambda development
- `scripts/stop-lambda-dev.sh`: Stops the Lambda development environment
- `scripts/test-lambda-email.sh`: Tests email processing through Lambda

#### LocalStack Configuration:
- Mocks AWS services locally (S3, SQS, DynamoDB, Lambda, Step Functions)
- Auto-creates required buckets and tables
- Configures S3 event triggers for Lambda
- Provides local endpoints for testing

### 3. Key Architecture Changes

**Before (Hermes-based)**:
```
Email → SES → SQS → Hermes → Container → S3
```

**After (Lambda-based)**:
```
Email → SES → S3 → Lambda → Step Functions → Container → S3
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/intake-lambda/index.ts`
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/intake-lambda/package.json`
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/intake-lambda/tsconfig.json`
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/process-attachment-lambda/index.ts`
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/process-attachment-lambda/package.json`
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/process-attachment-lambda/tsconfig.json`
- `/hephaestus/lambdas/process-attachment-lambda/Dockerfile`
- `/scripts/start-lambda-dev.sh`
- `/scripts/stop-lambda-dev.sh`
- `/scripts/test-lambda-email.sh`

### Modified:
- `/docs/REFACTOR_STATUS.md`: Updated with Sprint 2 progress

## Local Development Workflow

### Starting Development:
```bash
# Start Lambda development environment
./scripts/start-lambda-dev.sh

# Test email processing
./scripts/test-lambda-email.sh

# Monitor logs
docker logs -f localstack-manual
tail -f /tmp/webordinary-logs/claude-output.log

# Stop when done
./scripts/stop-lambda-dev.sh
```

### LocalStack Endpoints:
- S3: http://localhost:4566
- SQS: http://localhost:4566
- DynamoDB: http://localhost:4566
- Lambda: http://localhost:4566
- Step Functions: http://localhost:4566

## Next Steps (Day 6-7)

### Support Lambdas to Create:
1. **check-active-job-lambda**: DynamoDB check + interrupt send
2. **rate-limited-claim-lambda**: Conditional DynamoDB writes
3. **record-interruption-lambda**: Audit trail
4. **Unit tests**: Mock AWS services for testing

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Removed Hermes Dependency**: Local development no longer requires Hermes
2. **Improved Testing**: LocalStack provides full AWS service mocking
3. **Better Attachment Handling**: Sharp-based image optimization
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Direct S3 → Lambda flow
5. **TypeScript**: Type-safe Lambda implementations

## Technical Notes

### Lambda Memory Requirements:
- intake-lambda: 256MB (email parsing)
- process-attachment-lambda: 1024MB (Sharp image processing)

### LocalStack Configuration:
- Uses Docker network for inter-service communication
- Lambda executor runs in Docker mode
- Persistent data stored in `localstack-data/`

### Image Optimization Strategy:
- WebP for modern browsers (85% quality)
- Thumbnails at 400px max width (80% JPEG quality)
- Web standard at 1200px max width (85% JPEG quality)
- Original files preserved alongside optimized versions

## Risks & Mitigations

1. **Sharp in Lambda**: Using container image for better binary compatibility
2. **LocalStack Limitations**: Some AWS features may not be fully emulated
3. **Step Functions**: Not yet implemented, mocked in current setup

## Summary

Successfully created the core Lambda functions for email intake and attachment processing. The local development environment has been updated to use LocalStack instead of Hermes, providing a more accurate AWS simulation. The foundation is now in place for the Step Functions orchestration layer.

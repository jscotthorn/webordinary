# Auto-Sleep Pattern Removal Report
Date: 2025-01-13

## Summary

Removed all references to container auto-sleep/idle shutdown pattern. In the current architecture, containers claim project+user combinations and continuously process messages from queues - they don't go to sleep when idle.

## Changes Made

### 1. Test Files Updated
**`/tests/integration/scenarios/05-session-resumption.test.ts`**
- Updated test description to remove "Container auto-sleep when idle"
- Removed entire "Container Auto-Sleep Simulation" test section
- Replaced with "Container Claim Management" test that verifies containers maintain claims
- Updated comments to clarify no auto-sleep behavior

**`/tests/integration/src/integration-test-harness.ts`**
- Removed `simulateContainerAutoSleep()` method entirely
- Added `verifyContainerClaim()` method to verify project+user claims are maintained
- Updated documentation to note containers don't auto-sleep

### 2. Scripts Removed
**`/claude-code-container/scripts/auto-shutdown.sh`**
- Deleted deprecated auto-shutdown monitoring script
- Script was already marked as DEPRECATED and being replaced

## Current Architecture

### How Containers Work Now
1. **Claim Pattern**: Containers claim project+user combinations from unclaimed queue
2. **Continuous Processing**: Once claimed, containers keep processing messages
3. **No Idle Shutdown**: Containers don't shut down when idle
4. **Manual Scaling**: Use ECS to scale containers up/down as needed

### Scaling Commands
```bash
# Scale down to save money (manual)
AWS_PROFILE=personal aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster webordinary-edit-cluster \
  --service webordinary-edit-service \
  --desired-count 0

# Scale up when needed
AWS_PROFILE=personal aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster webordinary-edit-cluster \
  --service webordinary-edit-service \
  --desired-count 1
```

## Files Modified
- `/tests/integration/scenarios/05-session-resumption.test.ts`
- `/tests/integration/src/integration-test-harness.ts`

## Files Deleted
- `/claude-code-container/scripts/auto-shutdown.sh`

## Verification
- Tests updated to verify containers maintain claims
- No more references to auto-sleep or idle shutdown
- Architecture aligned with queue-based continuous processing

---
**Status**: Complete
**Pattern**: Auto-sleep removed
**Current Model**: Continuous queue processing with project+user claims

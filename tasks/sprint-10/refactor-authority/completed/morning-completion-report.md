# Morning Tasks Completion Report
Date: 2025-01-13
Duration: ~2.5 hours

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Clean Production DLQ
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Purged 22 test messages from `webordinary-email-dlq`
- Purged 2 test messages from `webordinary-unclaimed-dlq`
- Verified 8 test-specific DLQs were already empty
- Production queues now clean of test data

### 2. Fix Environment Variables
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Refactored `queue-manager.service.ts` to stop setting env vars
- Added `getCurrentClaim()` method to expose project/user info
- Updated 4 services to use queue manager instead of env vars:
  - `git.service.ts`
  - `s3-sync.service.ts`
  - `message-processor.service.ts`
  - All now use dependency injection pattern
- Legacy test files still have references but are non-critical

### 3. Run Audit Searches
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Comprehensive search across entire codebase
- Found ~25 files needing updates
- Identified 3 critical issues
- Results documented in `audit-results.md`

### 4. Prioritize by Impact and Risk
- **Status**: COMPLETE
- Created three-tier priority system:
  - HIGH: Blocking functionality (3 issues)
  - MEDIUM: Confusion risk (3 issues)
  - LOW: Cleanup tasks (3 issues)

## Key Findings

### Critical Issues Identified
1. **Session-per-container pattern** - Tests and infrastructure assume old pattern
2. **ALB routing rules** - Still configured for web traffic
3. **Port 8080 references** - Hermes still has HTTP server configs

### Next High Priority Actions
1. Update integration tests to use project+user pattern
2. Remove ALB web routing rules from CDK
3. Clean up Hermes HTTP server configuration

## Files Changed
- `/claude-code-container/src/services/queue-manager.service.ts`
- `/claude-code-container/src/services/git.service.ts`
- `/claude-code-container/src/services/s3-sync.service.ts`
- `/claude-code-container/src/message-processor.service.ts`

## New Documentation Created
- `/refactor-authority/audit-results.md` - Full audit findings
- `/refactor-authority/morning-completion-report.md` - This report

## Recommendations for Afternoon
1. Start with fixing integration tests (highest impact)
2. Remove port 8080 from Hermes configuration
3. Update component READMEs with current architecture
4. Consider creating migration scripts for test updates

## Notes
- Environment variable refactor introduces circular dependency risk
- May need to revisit dependency injection approach
- Test suite will likely break until updated
- Consider feature flag for gradual rollout

Ready for afternoon phase of refactoring.

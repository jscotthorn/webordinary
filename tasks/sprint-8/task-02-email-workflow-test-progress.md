# Sprint 8 Task 2: Test Email to S3 Workflow - Progress Report

## Current Status: In Progress
**Date:** 2025-08-11

## What's Been Accomplished

### 1. Infrastructure Deployment
- ✅ Hermes service successfully deployed via CDK
- ✅ Hermes container running and processing SQS messages
- ✅ Edit container running and healthy
- ✅ 14 emails in queue being processed

### 2. Services Running
```
Service                    Status    Count
webordinary-hermes-service RUNNING   1/1
webordinary-edit-service   RUNNING   1/1
```

### 3. Email Processing Active
- Hermes is successfully pulling emails from SQS queue
- Creating sessions for incoming emails
- Attempting to route messages to containers

## Issues Identified

### 1. Container Queue Configuration
**Problem:** Edit containers not configured with SQS queue URLs
- Missing `INPUT_QUEUE_URL` environment variable
- Missing `OUTPUT_QUEUE_URL` environment variable
- Container can't poll for messages

**Impact:** Messages can't flow from Hermes to containers

### 2. Hermes Email Parser Warning
**Problem:** `EmailReplyParser.parse is not a function`
- Non-critical: Falls back to raw text parsing
- Still processes emails successfully

### 3. Container Task Management
**Problem:** "Tasks cannot be empty" error when Hermes tries to manage containers
- Hermes attempting to find/start tasks but getting empty results
- May be related to container pool management

## Current Message Flow

```
Email (✅) → SES (✅) → SQS Queue (✅) → Hermes (✅) → [BLOCKED] → Container → S3
```

## What Needs Fixing

### Priority 1: Container Queue Configuration
Need to update Fargate stack to include:
```typescript
environment: {
  INPUT_QUEUE_URL: 'https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/942734823970/webordinary-unclaimed',
  OUTPUT_QUEUE_URL: 'https://sqs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/942734823970/webordinary-output',
  // ... other env vars
}
```

### Priority 2: Create Unclaimed Queue
- No unclaimed/pool queue exists for idle containers
- Need to create this queue for container pool management

### Priority 3: Fix Container Discovery
- Hermes can't find available containers
- May need to fix task discovery logic

## Logs Observed

### Hermes Processing
```
[Nest] 1  - 08/11/2025, 11:55:08 PM     LOG [EmailProcessorService] Processing email from SQS
[Nest] 1  - 08/11/2025, 11:55:08 PM    WARN [EmailProcessorService] Failed to parse email reply, using raw text
[Nest] 1  - 08/11/2025, 11:55:08 PM     LOG [EditSessionService] Created session 056da9e6-cf5d-43b8-abe0-789338bc0a8a for amelia/email-user
[Nest] 1  - 08/11/2025, 11:55:09 PM   ERROR [EditSessionService] Failed to start Fargate task for session
```

### Edit Container Status
```
Container started successfully
- Client: ameliastamps
- Workspace: /workspace
- S3 Bucket: https://edit.ameliastamps.webordinary.com
- Ready to process messages, build, and deploy to S3
- No INPUT_QUEUE_URL provided, SQS polling disabled
- No OUTPUT_QUEUE_URL provided, response sending disabled
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update CDK Infrastructure**
   - Add queue URLs to container environment
   - Create unclaimed queue if needed
   - Redeploy Fargate stack

2. **Verify Queue Creation**
   - Ensure project-specific queues are created
   - Check unclaimed queue exists

3. **Test Complete Flow**
   - Send test email
   - Monitor Hermes → Container → S3 flow
   - Verify S3 deployment

## Metrics
- Emails in queue: 14
- Sessions created: Multiple (056da9e6, 6c33f29e, etc.)
- Containers running: 1
- Hermes instances: 1
- Processing errors: Multiple (container routing)

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Fix container queue configuration in CDK
2. **Quick Win**: Create unclaimed queue for container pool
3. **Investigation**: Why Hermes can't find running tasks
4. **Long-term**: Implement proper container pool management

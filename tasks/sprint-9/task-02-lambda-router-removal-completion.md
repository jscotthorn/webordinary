# Sprint 9 Task 2: Remove Lambda Router

## Completed: 2025-01-11

### What Was Accomplished

1. **Verified Lambda Already Removed**
   - SessionRoutingStack not deployed in AWS
   - No Lambda functions with "Session" or "Router" in name
   - No CloudWatch log groups for session router
   - No IAM roles for session router

2. **Cleaned Up Codebase**
   - Removed `/lib/session-routing-stack.ts` (and .js, .d.ts files)
   - Removed `/lambdas/session-router/` directory and all code
   - Removed commented import from `bin/hephaestus.ts`
   - No cross-stack references found

3. **Verification Complete**
   - CDK builds successfully without errors
   - CDK synth completes without issues
   - No orphaned resources in AWS
   - All stacks remain functional

### Files Removed

```
/hephaestus/lib/
├── session-routing-stack.ts    ✅ Removed
├── session-routing-stack.js    ✅ Removed
└── session-routing-stack.d.ts  ✅ Removed

/hephaestus/lambdas/
└── session-router/             ✅ Removed (entire directory)
```

### Architecture Impact

**Before:**
- Lambda function for session-based routing
- Complex DynamoDB lookups for container mapping
- WebSocket upgrade handling attempts
- Container wake-up logic

**After:**
- Direct S3 static hosting
- No runtime routing needed
- Simplified architecture
- Reduced complexity

### AWS Resources Status

| Resource | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| SessionRoutingStack | ❌ Never deployed | No cleanup needed |
| Lambda Function | ❌ Never existed | No cleanup needed |
| CloudWatch Logs | ❌ Never created | No cleanup needed |
| IAM Roles | ❌ Never created | No cleanup needed |

### Testing Results

```bash
# Build verification
npm run build                    ✅ Success

# CDK synthesis  
npx cdk synth                    ✅ Success

# Lambda check
aws lambda list-functions        ✅ No session router found

# Stack check
aws cloudformation describe-stacks  ✅ Stack doesn't exist
```

### Cost Impact

Since the Lambda was never deployed:
- No direct cost savings
- Prevented future costs (~$2/month)
- Reduced complexity for maintenance

### What Was Different from Plan

The task plan assumed the SessionRoutingStack was deployed and needed to be destroyed. In reality:
- Stack was never deployed (already removed in Task 1 with ALB)
- Only code cleanup was needed
- No AWS resources to remove

### Cleanup Checklist

- ✅ SessionRoutingStack code removed
- ✅ Lambda function code removed
- ✅ Imports cleaned up
- ✅ Build verification complete
- ✅ No orphaned resources
- ✅ Documentation updated

### Next Steps

Continue with Task 3: Update Container Networking (already partially complete from previous work)

# Task 6: End-to-End Testing Results

## Test Summary
**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Objective**: Test the complete flow from email receipt to S3 deployment  
**Result**: PARTIAL SUCCESS with identified issues

## ‚úÖ What Worked

1. **Local Development Environment**
   - Docker Compose successfully starts both containers
   - Hermes starts and connects to AWS services
   - Claude container starts and runs NestJS application
   - Queue manager initializes and monitors unclaimed queue

2. **Queue Infrastructure**
   - Messages can be sent to SQS queues
   - Unclaimed queue (`webordinary-unclaimed`) is accessible
   - User/project specific queues exist (`webordinary-input-ameliastamps-scott`)
   - Environment variables properly configured in containers

3. **Service Connectivity**
   - Both containers connect to AWS services
   - DynamoDB tables accessible
   - S3 bucket accessible
   - SQS queues accessible

## ‚ùå Issues Identified

### 1. **Hermes Architecture Mismatch**
**Issue**: Hermes is still using the old Fargate-based approach instead of the new queue-based architecture  
**Impact**: Messages are not properly routed to queues  
**Evidence**:
```
[ERROR] Failed to start Fargate task for session
[ERROR] TaskDefinition is inactive
[ERROR] Container at 172.31.19.151 failed health check
```
**Solution Needed**: Update Hermes to use `MessageRouterService` instead of `FargateManagerService`

### 2. **Claude Container Queue Processing**
**Issue**: Claude container appears to consume messages from unclaimed queue but doesn't process them  
**Evidence**:
- Message sent to unclaimed queue: `d16bcece-e105-4199-acd5-db20ad421af3`
- Queue shows 0 messages (consumed)
- No processing logs in container
- No S3 uploads
- No entries in `webordinary-container-ownership` table

**Possible Causes**:
- Queue polling may not be working correctly
- Message format mismatch
- AWS SDK issues on ARM architecture

### 3. **AWS CLI Missing**
**Issue**: AWS CLI not available in Claude container  
**Impact**: S3 sync operations will fail  
**Evidence**:
```
[ERROR] [S3SyncService] AWS CLI not found in container
[ERROR] [Bootstrap] AWS CLI not found - S3 sync will not work
```
**Solution**: Install AWS CLI in Docker image or use AWS SDK for S3 operations

### 4. **Architecture Compatibility**
**Issue**: AWS CLI fails on ARM (M1/M2 Mac) when container built for AMD64  
**Impact**: Local development harder on Apple Silicon  
**Workaround**: Build containers for native platform in local dev

## üìä Test Data

### Email Flow Test
1. User sent email ‚Üí Received by SES
2. Email ‚Üí SQS `webordinary-email-queue` 
3. Hermes picked up message ‚úÖ
4. Hermes tried to start Fargate task ‚ùå (should route to queues)
5. Session created in DynamoDB with status "expired"

### Direct Queue Test
1. Message sent to unclaimed queue ‚úÖ
2. Message consumed from queue ‚úÖ
3. No visible processing ‚ùå
4. No S3 deployment ‚ùå
5. No Git branch creation ‚ùå

## üîß Required Fixes

### Priority 1: Update Hermes
- Replace Fargate task management with queue routing
- Use `MessageRouterService` for all message routing
- Send to user/project queue + unclaimed queue when no container assigned

### Priority 2: Fix Claude Container Queue Processing
- Debug why messages are consumed but not processed
- Add more detailed logging for queue operations
- Verify message format compatibility

### Priority 3: AWS CLI Resolution
- Option A: Install AWS CLI in container (increases image size)
- Option B: Use AWS SDK for S3 operations instead of CLI
- Option C: Mount AWS CLI from host in local dev

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Architecture Alignment**
   - Complete the Hermes refactor to use queue-based routing
   - Remove all Fargate-related code from email processing flow
   - Ensure both containers use the same message format

2. **Local Development Improvements**
   - Build containers for native platform in local dev
   - Consider using LocalStack for fully offline development
   - Add health check endpoints that don't require AWS

3. **Monitoring & Debugging**
   - Add more detailed logging for queue operations
   - Create debug mode that logs all SQS interactions
   - Add metrics for queue depth, processing time, etc.

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Create integration tests for queue-based flow
   - Add unit tests for message routing logic
   - Create end-to-end test script for the complete flow

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Fix Hermes** to use queue-based routing (est. 2-4 hours)
2. **Debug Claude container** queue processing (est. 2-3 hours)
3. **Add AWS CLI** or SDK-based S3 operations (est. 1-2 hours)
4. **Create integration tests** for the complete flow (est. 2-3 hours)

## üìù Conclusion

The local development environment is **partially functional**. Both containers start and connect to AWS services, but the message flow is broken due to:
1. Architecture mismatch between old (Fargate) and new (queue-based) approaches
2. Queue processing issues in the Claude container
3. Missing AWS CLI for S3 operations

Once these issues are resolved, the end-to-end flow should work as designed:
- Email ‚Üí Hermes ‚Üí Queues ‚Üí Claude Container ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Email Response

**Estimated effort to complete**: 1-2 days of development

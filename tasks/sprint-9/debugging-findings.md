# Message Flow Debugging Findings

## Summary
The message flow has **fundamental architecture mismatches** between Hermes and the Claude container that prevent end-to-end completion.

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. **Queue Infrastructure**
   - Claude container successfully polls the unclaimed queue
   - Container claims projects when receiving `claim_request` messages
   - Ownership is recorded in DynamoDB (`webordinary-container-ownership`)
   - Container switches to polling project-specific queue after claiming

2. **Message Reception**
   - Container receives messages from the project input queue
   - Message processor starts processing the instruction
   - Logging shows correct session and instruction extraction

3. **AWS Integration**
   - AWS SDK works correctly in the container
   - SQS operations (receive, delete) function properly
   - DynamoDB operations (put, update) work correctly

## ‚ùå Issues Found

### 1. ECS Service Competition
**Problem**: Production ECS service was running and consuming messages  
**Solution**: Scaled down `webordinary-edit-service` to 0 instances  
**Impact**: Messages were being consumed before local container could process them

### 2. Message Format Mismatch
**Problem**: Complete disconnect between what Hermes sends and what Claude container expects

**What Claude Container Expects**:
- For claiming: `type: "claim_request"` with `projectId` and `userId`
- For work: Message with `repoUrl` field for repository initialization

**What Hermes Actually Sends** (from DLQ analysis):
```json
{
  "sessionId": "test-local-dev",
  "projectId": "ameliastamps",
  "userId": "scott",
  "from": "escottster@gmail.com",
  "subject": "Test Local Development",
  "body": "Please create a test page...",
  "instruction": "Create a simple HTML page...",
  "threadId": "thread-local-test",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-12T13:15:00Z"
}
```
**Missing**: `type` field and `repoUrl` field

### 3. Repository Initialization Design Flaw
**Problem**: Repository URL not passed in messages  
**Root Cause**: 
- Claude container has code to clone repositories (`GitService.initRepository()`)
- Message processor was updated to handle `repoUrl` from messages
- But Hermes never sends `repoUrl` in messages
- The old `REPO_URL` environment variable is a global setting (wrong for multi-project)

**Code Evidence**:
- Hermes has `getRepoUrl()` method with hardcoded mapping
- Hermes uses repo URL for Fargate task environment variables
- But when sending to queues, repo URL is not included

**Impact**: Container can't clone the correct repository for each project

### 4. Shell Spawn Error (False Positive)
**Initial Error**: `spawn /bin/sh ENOENT`  
**Investigation**: `/bin/sh` exists and works when tested directly  
**Real Cause**: Git commands failing due to missing repository, not shell issues

### 5. AWS CLI Missing
**Problem**: AWS CLI not installed in container  
**Impact**: S3 sync operations cannot work  
**Code Evidence**: `S3SyncService` uses `execAsync('aws s3 sync ...')`
**Workaround Needed**: Either install AWS CLI in Docker image OR refactor to use AWS SDK

### 6. Message Processing Implementation Issue
**Problem**: `executeClaudeCode()` tries to spawn non-existent process
**Code Evidence**:
```typescript
// message-processor.service.ts line 195
this.currentProcess = spawn('claude-code', [...])
```
**Issue**: There is no `claude-code` CLI binary - should use `ClaudeExecutorService` instead

## üìä Message Flow Trace

### Current Flow (What Actually Happens)
1. **Email ‚Üí Hermes**
   - Email received by SES ‚Üí Sent to email queue ‚Üí Hermes picks up
   - ‚úÖ Working

2. **Hermes ‚Üí Queues**
   - Hermes tries to start Fargate task (old approach)
   - Should send to queues but still using old architecture
   - ‚ùå Not working correctly

3. **Unclaimed Queue**
   - Container expects `type: "claim_request"` messages
   - Hermes doesn't send this format
   - Manual test messages work
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Works with correct format only

4. **Project Queue ‚Üí Container**
   - Container receives message
   - Tries to initialize repository but no `repoUrl`
   - Tries to switch git branch but no repository exists
   - Tries to execute `claude-code` binary that doesn't exist
   - ‚ùå Multiple failures

5. **Container ‚Üí S3**
   - Never reached due to earlier failures
   - Would fail anyway due to missing AWS CLI
   - ‚ùå Not working

### Expected Flow (What Should Happen)
1. Email ‚Üí Hermes ‚Üí Parse instruction
2. Hermes ‚Üí Send to project queue AND unclaimed queue (if no container)
3. Container claims from unclaimed queue
4. Container polls project queue
5. Container receives message with `repoUrl`
6. Container clones/updates repository
7. Container processes with Claude API
8. Container builds Astro project
9. Container syncs to S3
10. Container sends response to output queue

## üîß Required Fixes

### Critical Architecture Fixes

#### 1. Hermes Message Router Integration
**Location**: `hermes/src/modules/email-processor/email-processor.service.ts`
- Replace `EditSessionService` with `MessageRouterService`
- Include `repoUrl` in message payload
- Send proper claim requests to unclaimed queue

#### 2. Message Format Standardization
**Both Hermes and Claude Container**
- Define standard message interface with required fields:
  ```typescript
  interface QueueMessage {
    type?: 'claim_request' | 'work';
    sessionId: string;
    projectId: string;
    userId: string;
    repoUrl?: string;  // Required for work messages
    instruction?: string;
    // ... other fields
  }
  ```

#### 3. Claude Container Message Processing
**Location**: `claude-code-container/src/message-processor.service.ts`
- Fix `executeClaudeCode()` to use `ClaudeExecutorService`
- Remove `spawn('claude-code', ...)` calls
- Ensure repository initialization happens before git operations

#### 4. AWS CLI Installation
**Location**: `claude-code-container/Dockerfile`
- Add AWS CLI installation:
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y awscli
  ```
- OR refactor `S3SyncService` to use AWS SDK

### Implementation Priority
1. **Fix Hermes routing** (most critical - nothing works without this)
2. **Standardize message format** (needed for components to communicate)
3. **Fix Claude execution** (needed for actual processing)
4. **Add AWS CLI** (needed for S3 deployment)

## üí° Key Discoveries

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Hermes and Claude container were developed separately with incompatible assumptions
2. **Message Format Never Defined**: No shared interface/contract between services
3. **Repository Management Unclear**: No clear strategy for multi-project repository handling
4. **Queue System Works**: The underlying queue infrastructure is solid
5. **Container Can Claim Projects**: The ownership model works when messages are correct

## üö® Critical Insights

### The Fundamental Problem
The system has **two separate architectures** running simultaneously:
1. **Old**: Hermes ‚Üí Fargate Tasks (with environment variables)
2. **New**: Hermes ‚Üí Queues ‚Üí Containers (with messages)

These were never fully integrated. Hermes still tries to start Fargate tasks while the Claude container expects queue messages with different formats.

### Why It Doesn't Work
1. **Hermes** was built for Fargate task management
2. **Claude Container** was built for queue-based processing
3. **Message formats** were never standardized between them
4. **Repository URLs** are handled via environment variables (Fargate) not messages (queues)
5. **The refactor was incomplete** - old code remains active

## üìà Effort Estimate

To make the system fully functional:
- **Hermes Refactor**: 4-6 hours (remove Fargate, implement proper queue routing)
- **Message Standardization**: 2-3 hours (define interfaces, update both services)
- **Claude Container Fixes**: 3-4 hours (fix execution, handle repos properly)
- **Testing & Debugging**: 4-6 hours (end-to-end validation)

**Total**: 2-3 days of focused development

## Conclusion

The local development environment revealed that **the production system is fundamentally broken** due to incomplete migration from Fargate to queue-based architecture. The components work individually but cannot communicate properly due to:

1. **Message format mismatches**
2. **Missing repository URL in messages**
3. **Hermes still using Fargate approach**
4. **Claude container expecting different message structure**

This is not a "local development issue" - it's a **system architecture issue** that affects production as well. The good news is that the queue infrastructure works well, and with proper message formatting and Hermes updates, the system can be made functional.

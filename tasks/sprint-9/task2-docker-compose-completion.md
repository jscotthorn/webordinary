# Task 2: Docker Compose Setup - Completion Report

## ‚úÖ Accomplished

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration (`docker-compose.local.yml`)
- Created comprehensive Docker Compose setup for both services
- Configured proper networking between Hermes and Claude Container
- Set up health checks for both services
- Added volume mounts for AWS credentials and workspace
- Configured environment variables for Bedrock integration
- Added optional LocalStack configuration (commented out) for offline development

### 2. Startup/Shutdown Scripts
- **`scripts/start-local-dev.sh`**: Comprehensive startup script with:
  - Prerequisites checking (Docker, AWS CLI, credentials)
  - Environment file creation from templates
  - Bedrock access verification
  - Container build and startup
  - Health check monitoring
  - Service status reporting
  
- **`scripts/stop-local-dev.sh`**: Clean shutdown script with:
  - Graceful service stopping
  - Optional volume cleanup with `--clean` flag

### 3. Configuration Validation
- Successfully validated Docker Compose configuration
- Confirmed all environment variables are properly loaded from `.env.local` files
- Verified volume mounts and network configuration

## üìù Key Architecture Adaptations

1. **No HTTP Ports for Claude Container**: Since we're using S3 deployment model, the Claude Container doesn't expose port 8080
2. **Health Check via Script**: Claude Container uses the Bedrock health check script instead of HTTP endpoint
3. **Bedrock Integration**: Both containers configured with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1`
4. **AWS Credentials**: Mounted read-only from host system for both containers

## üß™ Testing Status

- ‚úÖ Docker Compose configuration validates successfully
- ‚úÖ Scripts are executable and include proper error handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Full integration test pending (requires running containers with AWS services)

## üìö Usage Documentation

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start local development environment
./scripts/start-local-dev.sh

# View logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml logs -f

# Stop services
./scripts/stop-local-dev.sh

# Stop and clean volumes
./scripts/stop-local-dev.sh --clean
```

### Service Endpoints
- **Hermes API**: http://localhost:3000/hermes/health
- **Claude Container**: No HTTP endpoint (S3 deployment mode)

### Requirements
- Docker Desktop installed
- AWS CLI configured with `personal` profile
- Bedrock access enabled in AWS account
- `.env.local` files configured (created from templates)

## üîÑ Remaining Work

None for Task 2 - Docker Compose setup is complete and ready for testing.

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Test with Real Services**: Run the stack to verify AWS service connectivity
2. **Consider LocalStack**: For fully offline development, uncomment LocalStack service
3. **Monitor Costs**: Bedrock usage will incur costs even in development
4. **Document Troubleshooting**: Add common issues to documentation as discovered

## Next Steps

Task 2 is complete. The Docker Compose infrastructure is ready for:
- Task 3: Local Queue Configuration
- Task 4: Local Development Scripts (partially complete with start/stop scripts)
- Task 5: Documentation & Testing

The foundation for local development is now in place with proper container orchestration!

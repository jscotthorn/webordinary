# Sprint 3 Completion Summary

**Date**: August 9, 2025  
**Sprint**: 3 (Task 09 - Infrastructure Fixes and Documentation)

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved multiple infrastructure issues with the edit.amelia.webordinary.com deployment. The API endpoints are fully operational, repositories clone successfully, and all AWS services are properly configured. One remaining issue persists with the Astro development server not serving content on port 4321, though the process spawns successfully.

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. EFS Security Group Configuration
- **Issue**: Containers failing with "ResourceInitializationError: failed to invoke EFS utils commands"
- **Solution**: Added explicit EFS security group with NFS ingress rules in CDK
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `hephaestus/lib/efs-stack.ts`
  - `hephaestus/lib/fargate-stack.ts`

### 2. GitHub Authentication
- **Issue**: Repository cloning failed for private repos
- **Solution**: Enhanced credential handling with token injection and safe directory configuration
- **Repository**: Corrected to `git@github.com:jscotthorn/amelia-astro.git`
- **File Modified**: `claude-code-container/src/thread-manager.ts`

### 3. ALB Port Mapping
- **Issue**: All traffic routed to port 8080 regardless of target group
- **Solution**: Used explicit `loadBalancerTarget` configuration in CDK
- **File Modified**: `hephaestus/lib/fargate-stack.ts`

### 4. Auto-shutdown Timeout
- **Issue**: Containers shutting down after 5 minutes
- **Solution**: Extended AUTO_SHUTDOWN_MINUTES to 20 in CDK
- **File Modified**: `hephaestus/lib/fargate-stack.ts`

### 5. SSL Certificate Coverage
- **Issue**: edit.amelia.webordinary.com not covered by certificate
- **Solution**: Added *.amelia.webordinary.com certificate to ALB
- **Status**: Valid SSL/TLS for all subdomains

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issue

### Astro Dev Server Not Serving
- **Symptoms**: Process spawns but doesn't serve on port 4321
- **Impact**: Preview functionality unavailable
- **Workaround**: API endpoints remain functional for development
- **Next Steps**: Requires debugging of npm process spawning in container

## üìä Infrastructure Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ECS Services | ‚úÖ | Both edit and hermes services operational |
| ALB Routing | ‚úÖ | Properly configured with SSL |
| DynamoDB | ‚úÖ | Session tracking functional |
| CloudWatch | ‚úÖ | Metrics and logs working |
| EFS | ‚úÖ | Mounting successfully |
| API Endpoints | ‚úÖ | All /api/* routes functional |
| Astro Dev Server | ‚ùå | Process runs but not serving |

## üß™ Testing Validation

Integration tests confirm infrastructure is working:
- ‚úÖ 16/16 infrastructure validation tests passing
- ‚úÖ AWS service connectivity verified
- ‚úÖ ALB endpoints reachable
- ‚úÖ Test harness fully functional

## üìö Documentation Created

1. **INFRASTRUCTURE_STATUS.md** - Comprehensive status report of all fixes and issues
2. **claude-code-container/README.md** - Complete container architecture documentation  
3. **Updated READMEs** - Current architecture reflected in all project READMEs
4. **Integration Tests** - Validated infrastructure through automated testing

## üí∞ Cost Impact

- **Current**: ~$0.10-0.15/hour when active
- **Idle**: Services scale to 0 automatically
- **Recommendation**: Keep services scaled down when not debugging

## üéØ Sprint 3 Deliverables

- ‚úÖ Resolved EFS mounting errors
- ‚úÖ Fixed GitHub authentication for private repos
- ‚úÖ Corrected ALB port mapping configuration
- ‚úÖ Extended auto-shutdown timeout to 20 minutes
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive documentation
- ‚úÖ Validated infrastructure with integration tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Astro dev server issue documented but unresolved

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Debug Astro Server**: Investigate why npm process doesn't serve content
2. **Consider Alternatives**: Evaluate static preview builds vs dev server
3. **Monitor Costs**: Keep services scaled to 0 when not actively testing
4. **Production Ready**: API infrastructure is stable for production use

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Scale up edit service
aws ecs update-service --cluster webordinary-edit-cluster \
  --service webordinary-edit-service --desired-count 1 --profile personal

# Check logs
aws logs tail /ecs/webordinary/edit --follow --profile personal

# Run integration tests
cd tests/integration
AWS_PROFILE=personal NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules npm test

# Scale down (save costs)  
aws ecs update-service --cluster webordinary-edit-cluster \
  --service webordinary-edit-service --desired-count 0 --profile personal
```

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 Task 09 has been successfully completed with significant infrastructure improvements. The system is now more stable and properly configured, with clear documentation of both resolved issues and the remaining Astro server challenge. The API functionality is production-ready, while the preview functionality requires additional investigation.

# Task 04: Remove Web Server from Container - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully removed all web server components from the claude-code-container, simplifying it to focus solely on message processing and preparing for S3 deployment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Service Files
- ✅ Deleted `src/services/web-server.service.ts`
- ✅ Deleted `src/services/auto-sleep.service.ts` 
- ✅ Deleted `src/services/auto-sleep.service.integration.spec.ts`
- ✅ Deleted `src/services/astro.service.ts`

### 2. Updated main.ts
- ✅ Removed WebServerService import and initialization
- ✅ Removed AstroService import and build step
- ✅ Removed port binding references
- ✅ Simplified startup logging

### 3. Updated app.module.ts
- ✅ Removed WebServerService from providers
- ✅ Removed AutoSleepService from providers
- ✅ Removed AstroService from providers
- ✅ Kept only essential services: MessageProcessor, ClaudeExecutorService, GitService

### 4. Simplified Dockerfile
- ✅ Removed `EXPOSE 4321` directive
- ✅ Removed HEALTHCHECK directive
- ✅ Removed ASTRO_PORT environment variable
- ✅ Updated description label to reflect new purpose

### 5. Removed Health Check Script
- ✅ Deleted `scripts/health-check.sh` (no longer needed)

### 6. Updated package.json
- ✅ Removed `express` dependency
- ✅ Removed `@types/express` dependency
- ✅ Added `@aws-sdk/client-s3` for future S3 sync functionality

### 7. Fixed MessageProcessor
- ✅ Removed AstroService dependency
- ✅ Removed AutoSleepService dependency
- ✅ Updated preview URL to use S3 domain
- ✅ Removed activity recording calls

## Build Verification
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
# ✅ No type errors
# ✅ dist/ directory generated
```

## Container Architecture (Simplified)

### Before (Web Server Mode)
```
Container
├── Web Server (port 8080)
│   ├── Express API
│   ├── Static file serving
│   └── Health checks
├── Astro Dev Server (port 4321)
├── Auto-Sleep Monitor
└── SQS Message Processor
```

### After (Message Processing Only)
```
Container
├── SQS Message Processor
├── Claude Executor Service
└── Git Service
```

## Key Benefits
1. **Simplified Architecture**: No port management or HTTP concerns
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed Express and related packages
3. **Cleaner Codebase**: ~500 lines of code removed
4. **Better Separation**: Container focuses only on processing, S3 handles serving
5. **No Health Checks**: ECS task status is sufficient

## Files Affected
- `/src/main.ts` - Simplified bootstrap
- `/src/app.module.ts` - Reduced providers
- `/src/message-processor.service.ts` - Removed service dependencies
- `/Dockerfile` - No ports or health checks
- `/package.json` - Removed Express, added S3 SDK
- `/scripts/health-check.sh` - Deleted

## Next Steps
- Task 05: Add S3 sync functionality to automatically upload built Astro files
- Task 06: Test container locally with Docker
- Task 07: Deploy to ECS
- Task 08: Update CDK permissions for S3 access

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Web server successfully removed, container simplified to message processing only

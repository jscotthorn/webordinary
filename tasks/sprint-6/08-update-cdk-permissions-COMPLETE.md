# Task 08: Update CDK for S3 Permissions and Container Changes - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully updated CDK infrastructure to support S3 static hosting architecture by removing ALB dependencies and adding S3 permissions to the ECS task role.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. CDK App Configuration
- ✅ Removed ALB stack instantiation from `hephaestus/bin/hephaestus.ts`
- ✅ Commented out Hermes stack (depends on ALB)
- ✅ Removed ALB dependency from FargateStack
- ✅ Disabled session routing setup

### 2. FargateStack Updates (`lib/fargate-stack.ts`)
- ✅ Added S3 permissions to task role:
  ```typescript
  // S3 bucket access for static site deployment
  s3:PutObject, s3:PutObjectAcl, s3:GetObject, 
  s3:DeleteObject, s3:ListBucket, s3:GetBucketLocation
  Resources: arn:aws:s3:::edit.*.webordinary.com/*
  ```
- ✅ Added DynamoDB permissions for container lifecycle
- ✅ Added SQS permissions for message processing
- ✅ Removed port mappings (no longer serving HTTP)
- ✅ Removed health checks (no web server to check)
- ✅ Removed ALB target groups and listener rules
- ✅ Added S3 deployment URL output

### 3. Infrastructure Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted existing ECS service with old target group references
- ✅ Destroyed and recreated FargateStack without ALB dependencies
- ✅ Verified IAM permissions applied correctly

## Deployment Process

### Issues Encountered and Resolved
1. **Target Group Port Conflict**: Existing service had target group expecting port 4321
   - Solution: Deleted ECS service completely before redeployment

2. **CloudFormation Rollback**: Stack updates failed due to lingering ALB references
   - Solution: Destroyed FargateStack entirely and redeployed fresh

3. **Dependency Chain**: Multiple stacks depended on ALB
   - Solution: Commented out dependent stacks in CDK app

## Verification

### IAM Permissions Confirmed
```bash
AWS_PROFILE=personal aws iam get-role-policy \
  --role-name FargateStack-TaskRole30FC0FBB-sVBWFB588bTq \
  --policy-name TaskRoleDefaultPolicy07FC53DE
```

Verified permissions include:
- ✅ S3: PutObject, DeleteObject, ListBucket on edit.*.webordinary.com
- ✅ EFS: ClientMount, ClientWrite for workspace access
- ✅ SQS: ReceiveMessage, DeleteMessage for queue processing
- ✅ DynamoDB: PutItem, GetItem for session tracking
- ✅ CloudWatch: CreateLogStream, PutLogEvents for logging

### Stack Outputs
```
ClusterArn: arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:942734823970:cluster/webordinary-edit-cluster
ServiceArn: arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:942734823970:service/webordinary-edit-cluster/webordinary-edit-service
TaskDefinitionArn: arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:942734823970:task-definition/FargateStackEditTaskDef7F513F8D:12
S3DeploymentUrl: https://edit.amelia.webordinary.com
```

## Architecture Impact

### Before
- Container served Astro dev server on port 4321
- ALB routed traffic to container
- Health checks monitored web server
- Complex routing rules for sessions

### After
- Container only processes messages and builds
- No HTTP serving or port exposure
- S3 sync deploys static files
- CloudFront serves content with HTTPS
- Simplified, serverless architecture

## Next Steps
- Task 07: Deploy container to ECS with new S3 sync functionality
- Test end-to-end workflow: SQS → Container → Build → S3
- Verify CloudFront serves latest content

## Key Learnings
1. **Clean Removal Required**: Must delete services before removing target groups
2. **Stack Dependencies**: CDK dependency chain requires careful orchestration
3. **IAM Best Practices**: Specific resource ARNs better than wildcards
4. **Deployment Strategy**: Sometimes faster to destroy and recreate than update

## Commands for Future Reference

### Check IAM Permissions
```bash
# Get task role ARN
AWS_PROFILE=personal aws ecs describe-task-definition \
  --task-definition FargateStackEditTaskDef7F513F8D \
  --query 'taskDefinition.taskRoleArn'

# View policy document
AWS_PROFILE=personal aws iam get-role-policy \
  --role-name [role-name] \
  --policy-name TaskRoleDefaultPolicy07FC53DE
```

### Deploy CDK Changes
```bash
cd hephaestus
npm run build
AWS_PROFILE=personal npx cdk diff FargateStack
AWS_PROFILE=personal npx cdk deploy FargateStack --require-approval never
```

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - CDK infrastructure successfully updated with S3 permissions and ALB removal
